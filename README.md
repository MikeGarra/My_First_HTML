# My_First_HTML
Creating basic HTML files and learning how to properly understand HTML formatting.


This repository is to demonstrate the outcome of how much I have put into learning HTML. 
I have used photos from my travels and added links to websites that correlate with the information I decided to present in my HTML files.
I have enjoyed learning HTML and have it easy to learn and express how I want elements in a HTML file to be presented on the web. 
I learned this from a Udemy course - "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2024". It has made learning HTML more easy and the course is simple to follow and understand.

If you have the time look through the files and though it is beginner stuff enjoy what has been created! 

Thank you!

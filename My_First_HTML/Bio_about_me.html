    <p>Hello, my name is <i>Michael</i>. </p>

    <p>
    I have recently graduated from SNHU in <b>April of 2024</b>. 
    I was formerly a sheriff's officer for a department in New Jersey, 
    and decided to change careers to find something in the Computer Science
    world. Since starting my studies I have found a love for programming
    and creating software that I thought was impossible for me to do.

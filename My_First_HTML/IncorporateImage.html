    <p>Wildlife photography is capturing the moment of an animal in its
        natural habitat. A moment that is unique only to you as the
        photographer. Depending on the type of lense and settings on your
        camera as well as other softwares that improve photos, you can see
        amazing details of animals in the photos that are taken that would
        usually go unnoticed since that moment is frozen in time.
